# HackHolyoke
This project contains all files for the GoBikes Web app that Kevin Zhang, Ashley Chen, and Clare Pak created for HackHolyoke 2015. The back end is written in Javascript and HTMl, and the front end is written in CSS.

The project stems from Kevin Zhang's Olin College system for GoBikes. The checkout system is very primitive, using paper and pencil to track checkouts, leadings to missing bikes, confusion over ownership, and massive disorganization. This web app serves to solve that problem by creating a simple and easy to use design. 

On the website, users can check out, check in, reserve spots, report broken bikes, and even ping stragglers who are taking too long. The functions are protected such that others cannot mess with another's checkouts and reservations. In addition, the code is robust and generalized: the only thing that ties it specifically to GoBikes is the CSS interface. The back-end code is written entirely in an algorithm-based fashion, so checkouts and checkins and such can be applied to a diverse array of systems, such as libraries, shops, etc.

The team placed in the top 5 best hacks at HackHolyoke 2015 and won 2nd for the Groupon awards.
